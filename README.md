# Project Happy Thoughts API

This week's project was to create the API to use for the Happy Thoughts microblog project, replacing the back-end Technigo provided.

## The problem

Coming back after a ~three weeks holiday, head was a blur. Felt like I couldn't remember anything related to coding, so it was initially an uphill battle. Watching the videos and attending the Monday lecture, however, I was ready to tackle the project â€“Â which turned out to go quite smoothly, thankfully enough. Created the endpoints wasn't rocket science (I _did_ settle for the blue level, but still). 

The main issues I had, had to do with the deployment of the API, where I still haven't grok'd how Mongo, Atlas, Heroku etc. tie together. But following the instructions did the trick, and now I've managed to hook up the Happy Thoughts front-end to the back-end. Super stoked.
